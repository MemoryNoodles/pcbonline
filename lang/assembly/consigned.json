    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_title": "About SMT Assembly and PTH PCB Assembly",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_one": "• SMT assembly is surface mount assembly. It means mounting SMDs on bare PCBs without drilling. SMDs need reflow soldering.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_two": "• PTH PCB assembly, or THT, is through-hole assembly. PTH assembly requires drilling on PCBs and wave soldering.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_three": "• SMT assembly is automatic, and PTH PCB assembly is usually done manually.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_four": "• PTH components have much longer pins than SMDs, and SMDs have much smaller sizes (minimum 01005).",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_five": "• In the whole PCB assembly process, SMT assembly happens first, and then PCBAs are transferred to the PTH assembly lines.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_six": "• Before batch PCBA production, the first piece should be manufactured and tested, and a report is generated for clients to review and approve batch production.",
