    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_zero": "Multilayer PCBs are one of the most advanced PCB types that PCBONLINE offers. In multilayer PCBs, there are at least three layers of copper that are separated by layers of insulation that are known as dielectrics.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_one": "The multiple layers of electrical circuits are superimposed on one another with reliable, predetermined connection points to prevent misalignment of the layers. This type of PCB saves space compared to simple one or two-layer PCBs while also enabling an extremely high density of components to be mounted in close proximity to one another. This type of design is used extensively in various professional electronic devices due to their versatility.",

    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_title": "Advantages of Multilayer PCBs",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_one": "• Saves space and weight due to the ability to reduce the size of the PCB.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_two": "• Increased durability when exposed to nature because the inner layers are protected by dielectrics.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_three": "• Can be a fully rigid or rigid-flex construction by PCBONLINE according to your applications requirements.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_four": "• Eliminates the need to have multiple PCBs because circuits can be placed closely on one design.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_five": "• Improves a devices' functionality, capacity, and speed because a multilayer PCB can fit a lot of circuitry.",

    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_one": "• We can produce multilayer PCBs with layer counts up to 100 layers!",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_two": "• The width of traces are strictly controlled within tolerances of ±10%.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_three": "• The copper thickness plating of a hole is ≥20um which provides the best electrical conductivity.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_four": "• We use high quality materials with a high Tg by default to ensure high heat resistivity even when you may not specifically require it.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_five": "• Each layer is put under AOI to ensure the highest possible PCB quality.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_six": "• We have our own, in-house production line for the immersion gold process, which saves production costs and reduces the manufacturing time.",
