    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_zero": "PCBONLINE is able to produce PCBs with a high glass transition temperature (Tg) which enables your products to maintain high quality operation at high temperatures. High-Tg PCBs are able to maintain a rigid structure within their substrates at and above 170°C. High-Tg PCBs are able to maintain their mechanical and electrical characteristics at extremely high temperatures. High-Tg PCBs are widely used in communication, aerospace, defense, medical, automotive, and computer products.",
