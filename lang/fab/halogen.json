    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_one": "Want circuit boards for manufacturing halogen-free electrical products? PCBONLINE is your best halogen-free PCB supplier. Halogen-free PCB implies that the board does not contain halogens or include any compound obtained from these toxic elements.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_two": "Halogen-free PCB has excellent flame retardance because phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) replace the halogens. Using halogen-free PCB, your products can be shipped to all over the world.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_title": "Advantages of Halogen-Free PCB",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_one": "• The circuit board and mounted components do not contain halogens such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At).",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_two": "• Its substrate is phosphorus-based and phosphorus-nitrogen-based, which helps achieve a good flame retardant effect.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_three": "• Have lower thermal expansion coefficients (CTE), longer T-260/288 (time for telamination), and higher thermal decomposition temperature (Td). ",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_four": "• Thus is suitable for multiple reflux processes and able to withstand higher reflux temperatures in PCBA.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_five": "• Have lower water absorption than conventional halogen-based PCB due to the  nitrogen-phosphorus redox resin.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_six": "• Have good thermal stablity and is safe to assemble and use for all industries.",
