    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_title": "Overview of PCB Stencils",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_zero": "PCB stencils, also known as SMT stencils or solder paste stencils, are laser-cut stainless stencils used for PCB SMT assembly. This is how it works: a PCB stencil is placed in an SMT machine, and PCBs go past under it one by one. A scraper pushes the solder paste to pass SMT stencil openings to paste on PCB pads.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_one": "PCBONLINE manufactures SMT stencils while manufacturing PCBs. Creating PCB stencil openings isn't as easy as creating holes in the same size as PCB pads, especially for the pads of BGA, QFP, 0402/0201 components, USB, etc. With over 22 years of experience, PCBONLINE grasps all techniques and tips for PCB stencil manufacturing. Our PCB stencils ensure enough solder paste on all PCB pads.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_two": "",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_title": "Advantages of PCB Stencils",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_one": "• Low solder joint defect rate: solder paste is precisely printed onto PCBs through the SMT stencil holes.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_two": "• All through-hole electronic components have SMT equivalents, so SMT is versatile.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_three": "• Be an essential tool for assembling large-scale integrated-circuit chips.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_four": "• Prevent chances errors and be much more efficient than manually applying the soldering paste.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_five": "• SMT is cost-effective and reduces 30%-50% of cost than printing circuit boards manually.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_advantages_bottom_word_six": "• Using SMT, the size of electronic products is reduced by 40%-60%, and the weight is reduced by 60%~80%.",

    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_title": "Why Choose PCB Stencils from PCBONLINE",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_one": "• PCBONLINE adopts the laser cutting method characterized by high precision and easy to demodulate by trapezoidal opening.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_two": "• Our SMT stencil production is of little influence of objective factors, and accurate cutting is ensured",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_three": "• Stencil holes are conducive to the release of solder paste because of the naturally trapezoidal aperture design (the upper hole is 1mil-5mil larger than the lower).",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_four": "• Accurate data: PCB stencil hole size error is about 0.3, and the positioning accuracy is less than 0.12mil.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_five": "• Provide durable SMT stencils of thicknesses of 0.1mm, 0.12mm, 0.15mm, and 0.2mm.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_six": "• In SMT stencil design, we fully consider the mold release of solder paste, width/thickness, area ratio, tin connection, tin, etc.",
    "fcb_fab_flexible_why_choose_word_seven": "• Solve stress concentration issues in PCB stencil design, which avoids a series of SMT soldering defects. ",
