    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_one": "Carbon ink PCBs are printed circuit boards that apply silkscreen printing technology to print carbon ink on certain pads. The carbon PCB/carbon ink PCB is distinguished for its carbon film with resistance, which is conductive and permanent. The carbon ink film replaces some resistive components. Carbon ink PCBs are widely used, especially for the low-power electronics. The applications include TV, telephone, computer and its keyboard, electric organ, game console, micro cassette recorder, etc..",
