    "fcb_fab_flexible_overview_top_word_zero": "PCBONLINE manufactures and assembles best thick-copper PCB with high electrical conductivity. Thick copper, also named 'heavy copper', means that the thickness of copper is more than the 140um (4oz), while the standard PCB weights 1 to 2oz (35um). Thick-copper PCB features the high current-carrying capacity, ideal thermal management, and high-performance reliability. Thus it is in great demand and essential in harsh work environments like temperature fluctuations.",
