                designed or easily converted into projectile projectiles by
                the action of explosives; (2) any device that can be
                concealed on the body of a person who can release the bullet
                through the energy of the explosive; (3) any component part
                integral to the safe firing of a projectile by means of an
                explosive from a device described in (1) or (2); (4)
                ammunition designed for any firearm, including cartridge
                cases, primers, bullets or propellants; (5) bladed sword,
                which includes knives and any parts or components designed
                to cause personal injury. Bladed weapons include automatic

                accessory/part/component contributes to the function of the

                are attached to the weapon, but does not include knife cases
                or holsters, because they are neither attached to the weapon
