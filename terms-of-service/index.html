                relies on you to provide accurate information. The export
                classification indicates whether the product and related
                technology are controlled, the relevant jurisdiction, when
                an export license is required and whether the product and
                technology meet the conditions of the license exception.
                Wrong classification may result in violation of export
                controls, which may result in huge fines and other
                sanctions.

                designed or easily converted into projectile projectiles by
                the action of explosives; (2) any device that can be

                through the energy of the explosive; (3) any component part
                integral to the safe firing of a projectile by means of an
                explosive from a device described in (1) or (2); (4)
                ammunition designed for any firearm, including cartridge
                cases, primers, bullets or propellants; (5) bladed sword,
                which includes knives and any parts or components designed
                to cause personal injury. Bladed weapons include automatic

                accessory/part/component contributes to the function of the

                are attached to the weapon, but does not include knife cases
                or holsters, because they are neither attached to the weapon
