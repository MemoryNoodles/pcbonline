                1. Protecting all data generated by and provided to us by
                our users from being stolen, compromised,or used in
                violation with this policy.
            </li> <li>
                2. Never selling user-provided and user-generated data for
                financial gain or competitive advantage.
            </li> <li>
                3. Providing transparency for our users into what data we
                collect and what we do with it including what access third
                parties have to user data and for what purpose.
            </li> <li>
                4. Informing users if their data is compromised, either by
                failure to protect data or by order to surrender data to a
                legal authority, to the fullest extent we are lawfully able.
            </li></ul> <div class="policy-title">Data we collect from you</div> <ul><li>
                If you register an account with PCBONLINE.com, we’ll have
                access to your e-mail address and any additional contact
                information you choose to provide us. If you place an order,
                we retain a record of the contents of the order, delivery
                and billing address information, and any communication you
                might have with our sales people or engineering support
                teams about the order. If you browse PCBONLINE.com, with or
                without a login, we know for a limited time that a user at
                your IP address has visited pages on the site. We collect
                data on what products and content you browse in order to
                offer better value to you through personalized email, and to
                see which products/content are the most useful to you.
            </li></ul> <div class="policy-title">Sending emails to you</div> <ul><li>
                We send mail to you when the orders are placed, shipped, or
                ready for local pickup. We may also be in contact when an
                order requires payment before shipping, or if other issues
                prevent us from fulfilling an order.
            </li> <li>
                We will notify you if we believe their privacy has been
                compromised, if it is within our power to do so. For
                example, if we discover a customer’s account user login
                information has been exposed elsewhere on the web, or if we
                are compelled to disclose information to law enforcement.
            </li> <li>
                We may occasionally send you an email that you did not
                request or trigger with an action of any kind in order to
                promote a certain aspect of our site, products, or services.
            </li></ul> <div class="policy-title">

                If you email us, chat with us, or call us on the telephone
                for support we can and most of the time will record the
                interaction.This is done so for training and audit purposes
                and the private conversations between customers and support
                staff are never sold to or shared with third parties.

                In order to understand traffic to PCBONLINE.com and diagnose
                technical problems, we log individual web requests. These
                logs include time of request, individual IP address,
                referer, and user agent strings. We may retain these logs
                for up to 60 days, although individually-identifying
                information will be obscured after one week. In order to
                prevent fraud and detect malicious behavior, we log IP
                addresses for specific actions, such as creating a customer
                account and placing an order. This information is
                automatically deleted after no more than 60 days. Except in
                the case of malicious traffic, we will not share log data
                with any third party, unless compelled by legal process to
                do so.

                We use cookies to know when users are logged in to PCBONLINE
                services, and to track preferences such as display
                currencies and the rendering of product menus.

                should provide their PayPal email address. The user will
